# [Layout Framework](http://layout.hive.pt)

Simple UI framework, for a simple web application. It's meant to be used together with UX
Framework to provide a simple structure for rapid prototyping.

## Stylesheets

There are currently four variants of the stylesheet:

* **layout.css** - The "original" one, considered to be typographic
* **layout.flat.css** - Flat design style focused in vibrant and colorful application
* **layout.modern.css** - Modern design created for minimalist and simple applications
* **layout.webook.css** - Stylesheet created for the webook application

Extra files exist with specific purposes:

* **layout.data.css** - Data processing and showing related styles
* **layout.extras.css** - Extra domain specific styles that should be applied across multiple base styles
* **layout.printing.css** - Printing related styles

## Notes

The current recommended version of jQuery for the best behavior and compatibility is the 1.4.2.
